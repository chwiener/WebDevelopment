<h2>Blueberry Spoon Cake Recipe</h2>

<p><small>This recipe for a simple summer spoon cake draws the juices out of blueberries then pours them on top of a gluten-free cornmeal batter. As the cake bakes, some blueberries sink and form a stewy bottom, others bubble into chewy jam. The result looks like an upside down cobbler, or a muffin without its middle. It isn’t too sweet, and what it lacks in slice-ability and portability, it makes up for with tenderness and juiciness. Make sure to bake it on a tray to catch any batter or berries that rise over the rim — these are the cook’s midbake treat.</small></p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 Tablespoons (58 grams) of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>14 ounces (297 grams) of fresh blueberries</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) of granulated sugar, and more for topping</li>
    <li>Zest and Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (113 grams) of source cream, and more for serving</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (76 grams) of yello cornmeal</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (63 grams) of almond meal</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt</li>
    <li>Vanilla ice cream for serving</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9-inch glass pie dish.</li>
    <li>Put the blueberries, ¼ cup/50 grams sugar and the lemon zest and juice in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring here and there for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and the berries are glossy. Turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, cream the butter and remaining ½ cup/100 grams sugar together until the mixture is pale and fluffy. Add the egg and stir to incorporate fully before adding the sour cream. Stir to combine and set aside.</li>
    <li>In another medium bowl, combine the cornmeal, almond meal, baking powder and salt, and whisk. Make a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredients. Whisk to form a smooth batter, then pour into the greased pie dish, leveling the batter with a spatula or the back of a spoon.</li>
    <li>Spoon over the blueberries with their juices somewhat evenly distributing them and leaving some batter uncovered. Sprinkle with sugar to evenly cover the surface. Set the pie plate on a baking sheet to catch drips.</li>
    <li>Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the cake has taken on a deep nutty color around its edge, and a blueberry-less area of sponge springs back when you press with a finger. The jammy areas will feel underbaked and that is good.</li>
    <li>Leave to cool a little before serving warm with sour cream or vanilla ice cream, or both.</li>

</ol>
